You need download vlc(v2.1.5) from <ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/2.1.5/>.

Then copy `plugins`, `libvlc.dll`, `libvlccore.dll` to Debug.

For your convenience, I uploaded an executable release (include vlc(v2.1.5)) [here](https://github.com/YunYouJun/Advanced-Windows-Network-Programming/releases).

Good Luck!
