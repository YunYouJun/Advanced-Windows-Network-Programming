## Task

- [ ] 1. The first task is to implement a 100% reliable protocol for file transfer (ie: UDP DATA packets) between the server and the client with a simple error-control protocol (ie: stop and wait protocol ). 
- [ ] 2. Client connect from a random unprivileged port ( 8026) to the servers command port (2121) and sends command to Request a file name list and Retrieve ( download ) the file from server over TCP. 
- [ ] 3. The server would use port n-1 to send file data to the client port (n+1) over UDP. 
- [ ] 4. The server should use the select I/O model to manage the incoming connections from the client over TCP. 
- [ ] 5. The server should be a concurrent server that can provide downloading file service simultaneously for Server Client 20 21 1026 1027 1 Server Client 2020 2121 8026 8027 1 2 3 4 TCP UDP UDP TCP multi-clients (please write test cases in your report).
- [ ]  6. The Server should display relevant information about the current connection and downloading status. 
- [ ]  7. The client should use multi-thread to download files. 
- [ ]  8. The client should display relevant information about the current connection and downloading status (e.g. the downloading process information).
